Executable qb.py ver. 1.0

Python package that allows to simulate the time evolution of a two level system under the influence of an oscillating electric field, given the Rabi and Larmor frequencies. The time evolution is carried out through the standard 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

##DON'T MODIFY THE POSITIONS OF THE VARIABLES IN THE INPUT FILE#####

Usage: $ python qb.py file.in > file.out

INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION:
prefix = name assigned to the output files containing the evolved trajectory
P      = nuber of states (either 2 or 4)
ti     = initial time (s)
tf     = final time (s)
N      = number of time steps
S      = inidicates after how many steps the result is printed
n      = (different components) initial condition
wr     = Rabi frequencies (4x4 matrix for P = 4 , 4-dimensional vector for P = 2)
wl     = Larmor frequencies (4 for P = 4 , 1 for P = 2)
w      = frequency of the external electric field
F      = envelope function of external impulse (= 1)

Note that this version only supports calcualtions for P = 2.

The next step is to implement a more efficient version of the algorithm and generalise the method to four level systems. Eventually also the possibility of using a different envelope function for the electric impulsewill be implemented.
