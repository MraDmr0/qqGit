Executable qq.py Ver. 1.0

###################################################################################
Python package that allows to simulate the time evolution of a two (or four) level system under the influence of an oscillating electric field, given the Rabi and Larmor frequencies. The time evolution is carried out through the standard 4th order Runge-Kutta method to compute the occupations.

##DON'T MODIFY THE POSITIONS OF THE VARIABLES IN THE INPUT FILE#####

Usage: $ python qq.py file.in > file.out

INPUT FILE DESCRIPTION:

prefix = name assigned to the output files containing the evolved trajectory
P      = nuber of states (either 2 or 4)
ti     = initial time (s)
tf     = final time (s)
N      = number of time steps
S      = inidicates after how many steps the result is printed
n      = (different components) initial condition
wr     = Rabi frequencies (4x4 matrix for P = 4 , 4-dimensional vector for P = 2 in Hz)
wl     = Larmor frequencies (4 for P = 4 in meV, 1 for P = 2 in Hz)
w      = frequency of the external electric field (Hz)
mode   = string that determines the shape of the envelope function of potential (off , singimp , gauss , 2imp , 2gauss)
F      = amplitude of envelope function of external impulse (= 1)
t0     = initial time of first impulse (s)
t1     = final time of first impulse (s)
sigma  = spreading for gaussian shape
t0     = initial time of second impulse (s)
t1     = final time of second impulse (s)
Note that the current version only supports calcualtions for F = 1.

###Added Features###
With this release it has been added the possibility of executing the simulations also for the four level system, already optimized with numba. 
Moreover it has been added the possibility of using a few different shapes for the envelope function of the external potential.

The next step is to formalize the code and add a documentation and better error handling. Eventually also the possibility of using different frewuencies for multiple impulses.
